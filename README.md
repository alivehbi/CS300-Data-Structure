# CS300-Data-Structure
You can see my homeworks for data structure lecture, I got 100 from each of them.
## HW1: 
The code randomly generates a maze with the given size inputs, the maze has only one road to escape, 
after generating the maze code saves its coordinates as a txt then it finds the unique escape road and writes it into another txt. 
The maze and unique road are created with using stacks, struct, random and with classes.

## HW2: 
The code creates two detailed Notebooks, first one is created by using Binary Search Tree and the second one is created by AVL Search Tree. 
After that, the users can get information from notebooks, and they can see which one is faster.

## HW3: 
The code creates two search engines one of them created with Binary Search Tree and the other created with Hash Tables. 
User can enter the names of txt files that he/she wants to search in and then enter the search value and both engines try to find it. 
We can see which of search engine is faster.

## HW4: 
The code uses for different sorting methods to sort a Phonebook, 
and then compares their speed in different search methods: Sequential Search and Binary Search
